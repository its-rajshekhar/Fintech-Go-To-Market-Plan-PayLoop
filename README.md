## 💸 CAC & LTV Simulation

| Month | Users Acquired | CAC (₹) | LTV (₹) | ROI |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 1 | 500 | 58 | 160 | 2.8x |
| 2 | 800 | 52 | 180 | 3.5x |
| 3 | 1200 | 49 | 190 | 3.9x |

**Insight:** Creator-led channels reduce CAC by ~25% vs paid ads in Tier-2 beta.

## 🧠 Growth & Retention Tactics

- **Campus ambassadors:** low-cost, high-trust acquisition.  
- **Creator partnerships:** micro-influencers for proof & trust.  
- **Gamification:** streaks, friend challenges, leaderboards.  
- **Progressive KYC:** step-up only when needed to reduce drop-offs.

---

## ⚠️ Risks & Mitigations

- **KYC friction:** progressive KYC + offline campus verification drives.  
- **Regulatory risk:** partner only with RBI-compliant fund managers & show badges.  
- **High CAC:** prioritize organic + creator channels until DMF positive.

## 🗺 Implementation Roadmap (90 days)

**Phase A (0–30 days):** Beta recruit & instrument analytics.  
**Phase B (31–60 days):** Onboarding fixes & creator pilots.  
**Phase C (61–90 days):** Referral expansion & monetization experiments.
